# Individual-HW2

This project is a simple Java-based Question-Answer Management System that allows users to store, update, delete, and retrieve questions and answers. It uses HashMaps for efficient data management and ensures data persistence by saving information in text files, so previously entered questions and answers are not lost when the program is restarted. Users can add new questions, modify or delete existing ones, and provide answers to stored questions. The system also allows viewing all saved questions and their corresponding answers. With a user-friendly menu-driven interface, input validation, and error handling, the program ensures smooth interaction and prevents invalid operations. The project follows fundamental CRUD operations and includes UML diagrams to illustrate its structure and workflow.
